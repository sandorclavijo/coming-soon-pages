# 🚀 Coming Soon Pages

This repo contains a collection of elegant “Coming Soon” and splash pages crafted for different industries—from civic awareness campaigns to tech launches and food brands.

> As a developer, I’ve often found myself frustrated when looking for 'Coming Soon' pages. Most options are either too generic, bloated with unnecessary code, or locked behind a paywall. It was tough finding a solution that felt both professional and customizable.

> That's why I decided to build this collection, and I’m sharing it with you for free. No hidden costs, no messy code—just clean, customizable templates to help you get your project off the ground. And it’s only the beginning! I’ll keep adding more, so you’ll always have fresh options to choose from.
